# tags

GitHub Tags can help us see the repository at different “ important ” times in GitHub. Clicking on Tags (as I have done in the above screenshot) will show a list of all the tags in the reverse chronological order, i.e., the latest created tag will be on the top. Select any one of the tags from the list. The repository will refresh now.
